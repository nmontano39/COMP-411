# Program Organization





# Testing Processes

We tested our program using the provided test cases along with many of our own. We created testXXX cases to handle cases
such as Let, Letcc, UnOpSimple/Complex, BinOpSimple/Complex, IfSimple/Complex, BlockSimple/Complex, and many
more while using cpsCheck, sdCheck, and allEvalCheck as we progressed through each phase. Our code passes all 53 tests
with 86% line coverage in SymEvaluator.
