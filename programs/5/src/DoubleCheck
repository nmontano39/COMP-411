This file contains the stuff we're not a 100% sure about, specifically in terms of coding style.

1. Since we now have TypedVariables as well as Variables, we compare these by making sure that the
names are the same.
Eg: let x:int := 5; in x + 7

Here x is saved as a typed variable in the environment when going through the def (:=) of the let,
but is looked up as a variable in order to compute x+7 because this is just an expression.
